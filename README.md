## Overview of the Project
This project introduces key time series concepts such as stationarity, trends, seasonality, and statistical models like AR, MA, ARMA, and ARIMA.  
You will learn how to implement these models and understand their applications in financial data.

Later, you will explore Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), focusing on LSTM networks for modeling sequential data.  
The final task involves building a hybrid ARIMA-LSTM model to predict stock prices.  
The major focus is on implementation, supported by a solid theoretical foundation.
